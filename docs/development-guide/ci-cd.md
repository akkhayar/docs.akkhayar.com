Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) is a set of practices that automates the processes of building, testing, and deploying code changes. CI/CD is a core part of DevOps culture and is a fundamental building block of modern software development.

## CI/CD Pipeline

In Akkhayar, we use GitHub Actions to automate the CI/CD pipeline. The CI/CD pipeline is a sequence of steps that are executed to build, test, and deploy the code changes. The pipeline is defined in the `.github/workflows` directory of the project repository. The pipeline is triggered by a GitHub event, such as a push to the repository or a pull request.
