## Working on a Feature Branch

When you create a branch under an issue, there will be a dialog containing the commands needed to checkout to that branch. You will do this before beginning any development to make sure that the changes you are making goes to the issued feature branch.

It looks something like:

```bash
git fetch origin
git checkout <`branch_name`>
```

The same thing can be done if you're on **Visual Studio Code** through icons provided by the git extension to the status bar. Firstly, make sure that you've installed the git vscode extension
