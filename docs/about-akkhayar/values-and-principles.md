# Values and Principles

At the personal level, there are three core values that govern the organization. They are the foundation of the community and are the guiding principles for all of our actions.

1. Modernization
2. Creativity
3. Social Work


## Modernization
Akkhayar is an agile organization that is constantly evolving. We are not afraid to try new things and we are not afraid to fail. We are not afraid to be different and we are not afraid to be ourselves. One of the central aims of Akkhayar is to modernize the software industry in Myanmar. We want to bring contemporary design principles, modern developmente practices, and new ways of creating software to the country.

## Creativity
Modernity brings simplicity to solve complex problems, but creativity is the algorithm. So we encourage our members to be competent and creative.

## Social Work
The founding principle of Akkhayar is to provide a platform for the next generation of developers to gain experience and to build their portfolio.

Our open sourced model and transperancy enables us to achieve this goal:

1. Since the software is open sourced, the community can contribute to the project and learn from it. 
2. Since the organization is transparent, the community can see how the organization is run and learn from it.
