# Introduction

![üå∏-flowers](/img/leaves.gif)

## The Akkhayar Handbook

The documentation is a collection of guidelines and best practices for the organization. It is a living document that the community can contribute to. It is a work in progress and will be updated as we learn more about what works and what doesn't. The handbook itself is publicly available with little viewing restrictions for the sake of transparency and accessibility.

### Mission

Mass scale open-sourced collaboration is a new concept in Myanmar, and tremendous potential and resources lay to waste. We are trying to build a community that is transparent, accessible, and sustainable. At the same time, we can provide newer and junior developers with the much-needed experience in the professional landscape. Being a part of Akkhayar is not the same as working for a company, but it is also not the same as being a part of a loose community. We are a hybrid of the two. You will find out what that means moving forward.
