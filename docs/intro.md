# Introduction

The Akkhayar Handbook is a collection of guidelines and best practices for the organization. It is a living document that everyone in the community can contribute to. It is a work in progress and will be updated as we learn more about what works and what doesn't. It is publicly available with little viewing restrictions for the sake of transparency and accessibility.

Mass scale open sourced collaboration is a new concept in Myanmar. Tremendous potential and resources lay to waste as a result.

We are trying to build a community that is open, a community that is transparent and accessible, resilient and sustainable. We are trying to build a community that is modern and creative.
