# Introduction

The Akkhayar Handbook is a collection of guidelines and best practices for the Akkhayar community. It is a living document that everyone in the community can contribute to. It is a work in progress and will be updated as we learn more about what works and what doesn't. It is publicly available with little viewing restrictions for the sake of transparency and accessibility.
